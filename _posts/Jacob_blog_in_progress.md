### Thoughts on Previous Parts: 
"Simply put, the higher the value the worse the model is..." > Not quite true. But we should bring up the idea that this is typically how loss is thought of.

# Visualizing the Loss Landscape 
The loss landscape graphically represents the model's loss function, a measure of how well the model can make predictions on a given dataset. Previous work has shown that structure of the loss landscape foretells the generalizability and robustness on a model solution \[ref...\]. 
Additionally, recent optimization methods levereging local loss information have led to drastic training improvements for many deep learning models \[ref SAM\]. Most papers use loss visualization to validate model performance and provide comparison between solutions. In contrast, here we describe methods and heuristics for analyzing the loss landscape with the intention to improve models.

## A Deeper Background Into Loss
In deep learning, loss measures how well a model's predictions match the ground truth or expected output for a given input data. 
By minimizing loss through the optimization process, we improve the model's ability to make accurate predictions on unseen data. 
</br></br>
Deep learning differs from traditional optimization in that the process for obtaining a minima matters more than the actual value of the minima acheived.
For example, the figure below depicts a vision transformer trained with two different optimization techniques. Despite one model having substantially lower loss and higher training accuracy, its test accuracy is 10% lower.

The world of machine learning commonly reffered to this as overfitting. After a certain point, overtraining models lead to poorer performance on unseen data. Overfitting typically occurs when a model has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available and the model learns patterns in the training data that do not generalize and decrease performance.
</br></br> 
Though the models above contain far sufficiet paramaters to overfit, they cannot be overcome by regularization techniques alone. As seen below, increasing the regularization does not make up for the difference.

## Intro to Loss Landscapes
The loss landscape graphically represents the model's loss as a function of its parameters, which can provide insight into the training process of the model and its final test performance. 
The loss landscape is typically visualized as a one or two-dimensional plot, an approximation of the true high-dimentional function landscape. Thus, the loss landscape only represents a small slice of the full function space, 
with the dimensions and axes of the plot being determined by the specific parameters that are being visualized. 
</br></br> 
Since the loss landscape selects only a slice of the true function space, it is essential to understand the various techniques for slicing as well as heuristics for improving loss landscape reliability and interpretability. 
As seen in the example below, even modifications to the distance to traverse can lead to large, unexpected changes in the loss landscape visualization.

Despite this limitation, the loss landscape can still be a useful tool for understanding how the model is training and identifying potential problems or issues with the optimization process. 
For example, a smoothly-varying loss landscape may indicate that the model is training well and that the optimization algorithm is making progress towards a good solution. 
In contrast, a rugged or highly-irregular loss landscape may indicate that the optimization algorithm is struggling to find a good solution, and may require further tuning or adjustments.

## Methods for Loss Landscapes

While loss landscapes have immense value, their python libraries 
are finicky. The original paper for [Visualizing the Loss Landscapes of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09913.pdf) 
published a github repository located [here](https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape). Rather, we rec

## Heuristics for Loss Landscapes


## Further Exploration of Loss Landscapes


</br></br>
The loss landscape is typically plotted on a graph, with the x-axis representing the number of training iterations (also known as epochs) and the y-axis representing the value of the loss function. The resulting graph will typically have a distinctive "valley" shape, with the loss decreasing as the model is trained and reaching a minimum at the end of training. This minimum value is the point at which the model has achieved the best possible performance on the given dataset.
</br></br>
The math behind the loss landscape involves a number of complex concepts from machine learning and optimization theory. At a high level, the loss function used in the loss landscape is typically a measure of the difference between the model's predicted output and the true output. This difference is often quantified using a metric such as mean squared error or cross-entropy loss. The gradient descent algorithm used to train the model then adjusts the model's parameters in order to minimize this loss function, ultimately leading to a model that is able to make accurate predictions.
</br></br>
After training a machine learning model, one can visualize the loss landscape by using various techniques that reduce the high dimensionality of the model's parameter space and the data space to a two-dimensional surface. One such technique is 1-dimensional linear interpolation, which involves projecting the high-dimensional space onto a one-dimensional line and then interpolating the points on this line to create a two-dimensional surface.
</br></br>
Another technique is to use contour plots, which involve dividing the two-dimensional surface into a series of concentric contours, each representing a different level of the loss function. This creates a visual representation of the shape of the loss landscape and allows one to see how the loss changes as a function of the model's parameters.
</br></br>
Finally, one can also use random directions to visualize the loss landscape. This involves selecting a random direction in the high-dimensional space and then projecting the points onto this direction to create a two-dimensional surface. This can provide a different perspective on the loss landscape and can help to identify areas of the space where the loss is particularly high or low.
</br></br>
Overall, these techniques can provide valuable insights into the performance of a machine learning model and can help to identify potential improvements or issues with the model.
