Our blog post describes the paper
[Emergent Symbols through Binding in External Memory](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LSFCEb3GYU7)
that was published at ICLR 2021.

## Introduction

Human intelligence is often described as 'symbolic'
because we are able to take complex sensory inputs and map
them to abstract concepts, represented by logical rules and symbols.

To illustrate this, consider the following scene with four objects
of differing shape, size and color:

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/clevr.html %} 

Many of us are able to quickly identify all of the objects
in this scene. Once we do this, we can recognize certain
logical relationships between the objects:
* The green cube is taller than the red cylinder.
* The red cylinder is taller than the yellow sphere.

Given just the last two statements however,
we can quickly infer that
"The green cube is taller than the yellow sphere",
even if we did not notice this when looking at the original image!
We can formally denote this process of logical reasoning
by the proposition: 

$$
  (\text{G} > \text{R}) \text{ and } (\text{R} > \text{Y}) \implies (\text{G} > \text{Y}).
$$

Here, we have assigned the height of the green cylinder to the symbolic variable $\text{G}$,
expressed by the statement $G = \text{height}(\text{green cylinder})$, and so on.
The assignment of a concrete value to an abstract symbol is called *binding* (or *variable-binding*).

Humans have an immense ability to understand abstract relationships
and reason about them in a logical manner.
This is due to our ability to reason using abstract symbols (such as $G$)
without worrying about their concrete values (such as the exact height of the green cylinder).

However, such abstract reasoning has been difficult to emulate artificially;
many state-of-the-art language generation models today [struggle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118)
at simple logical tasks that even children excel at.

The drive to create intelligent systems
that could perform some sort of logical reasoning is not recent.
In the 1980s, research focused on symbolic systems
(sometimes called classical AI)
that tried to model knowledge
as a vast body of logical statements
that could then be queried over.
These were wildly successful at the time:
best illustrated by expert systems such as
[MYCIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycin)
and [Dendral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendral),
and [IBM's Watson](https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/watson/)
that won at 'Jeopardy!'.

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/watson.html %} 

However, a major limitation of these systems was
the need for well-defined structured inputs.
In our CLEVR example above, they would need external supervision
to identify the different objects and their properties
in the scene. Thus, such 'classical' systems
lacked the ability to infer structure
from high-dimensional sensory observations of the world.

As a result, interest has gradually shifted to
intelligent systems that can operate naturally
on 'raw' high-dimensional data such as audio and video,
exemplified by the rise of deep learning. The promise of deep learning is to
do function approximation in a high-dimensional space,
enabling predictive models that can operate on 'raw' data.
While deep learning models have led to pivotal breakthroughs
across multiple domains - computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, to name a few -
the downside is that these models are effectively 'black boxes'
with little insight into what exactly is being modelled.
 
The paper
[Emergent Symbols through Binding in External Memory](https://openreview.net/forum?id=LSFCEb3GYU7)
that we will describe in this blog post
shows that careful design choices can encourage
neural networks to do symbolic reasoning,
while still operating on high-dimensional inputs.

## Symbolic Tasks

To understand how well machine learning models can perform abstract reasoning, the authors construct
a set of $4$ increasingly difficult tasks:
* **Same-Different**: Identify whether two images are the same or different from each other.
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/same_different.html %}

* **Relational Match-To-Sample (RMTS)**: Given a source pair of images which have some relationship between them,
identify which of two target pairs of images have the same relationship.
Here, the authors considered the 'same-different' relationship:
the source pair consists of either the same or different images.

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/rmts.html %}

* **Distribution of Three**: A row of three distinct images is provided.
This row is permuted to form a second row of images, but the last image is removed.
Identify which of four options was the removed image from the second row.

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/dist3.html %}

* **Identity Rules**: A row of images following a repetition rule (*ABA*, *ABB*, or *AAA*) is provided.
A second row of images is provided, with the last image removed.
Identify which of four options should be filled in the second row to follow the same repetition rule.

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/identity_rules.html %}

The authors create a pool of $100$ common symbols (eg. the triangle and square above).
For each task, $m$ symbols are kept withheld, completely unseen during training.
The remaining $100 - m$ symbols are used to generate example problems in the training set.
To test generalization capabilities, the training set is limited to a size of $10000$ problems,
which is much smaller than the total number of problems that can be created with these $100$ symbols.

## Models Evaluated

Each instance of these tasks can be thought of as a sequence,
where the individual input images and options are presented 
one timestep at a time.
The final prediction (for example, a softmaxed probability over the four options)
can be generated after the entire sequence is seen.

With this in mind, the overall setup that the authors consider consists of two stages:
* The Image Encoder $f_e$: Maps input images at each timestep to an embedding vector.
Most of the experiments in the paper use a 
trainable convolutional neural network (CNN) for the image encoder,
but there are additional experiments with a trainable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a fixed random CNN too.
* The Sequence Model $f_s$: Operates on the output of the image encoder to generate the final predictions.
The authors consider multiple strong baselines for the sequence model here,
described in the next subsections.

### 1. Emergent Symbol Binding Network
The Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN) is one of the key contributions of this paper.

The ESBN consists of an LSTM controller with access to an external memory $M$.
The external memory allows the LSTM controller to 'remember' what it has seen before.
Further, the memory is factorized into a key component $M_k$ and a value component $M_v$.
This memory supports only insertions: at each timestep, a single key-value pair is appended to the memory.

As a high level summary, the ESBN performs the following operations
at every timestep t:
* Encode $x_t$ with the image encoder $f_e$ to get $z_t$.
* Compute the 'read key' $k_{r_t}$ using $z_t$.
* Use $k_{r_t}$ to update LSTM hidden state $h_{t}$.
* Compute the 'write key' $k_{w_t}$ using the LSTM.
* Write key $k_{w_t}$ to memory $M_k$ and value $z_t$ to memory $M_v$.

Below is an animated description of these operations:
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/esbn_visualization.html %}

For ease of exposition, we have chosen a different (but completely equivalent)
order of operations here than the original paper.

We now describe exactly how the 'read key' and 'write key' are computed.

#### Computing the Read Key $k_{r_t}$

First, we compute weights $w$ over the values existing in $M_v$:

$$
w = \text{softmax}(M_v \cdot z_t)
$$

Compute confidence values $c$:

$$
c = \sigma\left(\gamma (M_v \cdot z_t) + \beta \right)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid activation, so that
each $c_i$ is bounded between $0$ and $1$.
$\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnt gain and bias parameters.
The confidence values are useful to indicate how much
of a match is present between the current encoded symbol $z_t$ 
and the values already seen in memory.
Unlike the weights $w$,
the confidence values do not have to sum up to $1$.
The confidence values especially help for the
**Same-Different** and **RMTS** tasks,
where the ability to directly answer
whether a particular symbol has been seen before
is particularly useful.

We concatenate the confidence values $c_i$ to the keys $M_{k_{i}}$,
weight them by the attention weights $w_i$, sum them up, and pass them through
the gated mechanism $g_{t - 1}$ to get the 'read key' $k_{r_t}$:

$$
k_{r_t} = g_{t - 1}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{t - 1} w_i \left(M_{k_{i}} \parallel c_i\right)\right)
$$

#### Updating the LSTM Hidden State

We use the just-computed 'read key' $k_{r_t}$ to update the LSTM's hidden state:

$$
h_t = \text{LSTM}(h_{t - 1}, k_{r_t})
$$

#### Computing the Write Key $k_{w_t}$

We use the LSTM's update hidden state $h_t$ to compute the next 'write key' $k_{w_t}$,
as well as the gated mechanism $g_t$ for the next timestep and output $y_t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
k_{w_t} &= \text{ReLU}(\text{Linear}(h_t)) \\
g_t &= \sigma(\text{Linear}(h_t)) \\
y_t &= \sigma_{\text{pred}}(\text{Linear}(h_t)) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\sigma_{\text{pred}}$ is either the sigmoid activation or the softmax activation,
depending on the number of options present.

This key $k_{w_t}$ is now concatenated to the memory $M_k$:

$$
M_{k} \leftarrow M_{k} \parallel k_{w_t}
$$

and the associated value $z_t$ representing the encoded image at the current timestep
is concatenated to the memory $M_v$:

$$
M_{v} \leftarrow M_{v} \parallel z_t
$$

Note that the LSTM controller never operates directly on the encoded image representations $\{z_t\}$.
Thus, the keys computed by the LSTM controller can be thought of as abstract 'symbolic' representations
of the input seen so far. In a later section, we will justify why we can call these representations 
'symbolic' by a visual analysis for the different tasks.

The paper compares the performance of the ESBN
against some popular baselines.
To understand how the ESBN differs from these baseline models,
we now describe their working in detail.

### 2. Neural Turing Machines (NTM)
The [Neural Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf) couples a recurrent
neural networks with an external memory.
This external memory is accessed by an attention-based mechanism. 
The memory matrix in the NTM is an updatable fixed-size look-up table
unlike the ESBN where entries are concatenated to the memory at each timestep
and cannot be overwritten.

As another point of comparison, the NTM uses multiple separate read and write heads,
thus enabling parallel reads and writes to the memory. 

Each read head produces a weighting $w_t$
over the memory indices, and the value $r_t$
read from the memory is simply a convex
combination of the memory values with these weights:

$$
r_t = \sum_i w_t(i) M(i)
$$

Each write head generates a weighting $w_t$
over the memory indices,
a common erase vector $e_t$
and a common add vector $a_t$.
The index $i$ in the memory is then updated as:

$$
M(i) \leftarrow M(i) \odot [1 − w_t(i)e_t] + w_t(i)a_t
$$

where $\odot$ indicates element-wise multiplication.

To compute these weightings $w_t$,
the NTM makes use of both content-based
as well as location based addressing.
In particular, each read head generates a read key vector $k_t$
and a key strength $\beta_t$
to compute the content-based weights $w^{(c)}_t$ as:

$$
w^{(c)}_t = \text{softmax}\left(\beta_t \cdot \text{sim}(k_t, M_t(i))\right)
$$

where $\text{sim}$ is the cosine similarity measure.
The read head then generates a gate value $g_t \in (0, 1)$ to weigh
the content-based weights $w^{(c)}_t$
relative to the weights at the previous timestep:

$$
w^{(g)}_t = g_t w^{(c)}_t + (1 - g_t)w_{t - 1}
$$

Then, to allow for rotational shifts of the memory,
the read head generates a softmaxed shift vector $s_t$,
which is then used to aggregate weights across neighbouring
positions in the memory:

$$
w^{(r)}_t(i)
=
\sum_{j = 1}^N w^{(g)}_t(j) \cdot s_t((i − j) \ \text{mod} \ N)
$$

The final weights $w_t$ are obtained by sharpening
these weights to avoid 'blurring' of the same 
content across multiple memory indices.
This is controlled by another scalar $\gamma_t$
emitted by the read head:

$$
w_t = \text{softmax}\left(\left(w^{(r)}_t\right)^{\gamma_t}\right)
$$

In conclusion, the NTM's memory addressing mechanism
is quite sophisticated compared to that of the ESBN.
Training such a mechanism can also be quite difficult, however.
A key difference is the explicit factorization of
ESBN's memory between the image embeddings (what it perceives)
and the corresponding 'symbolic' representations.

### 3. Metalearned Neural Memory (MNM)

The external memory used in both the ESBN and the NTM
are simple in the way they are implemented
as a large look-up table of values.
An alternative approach is to model memory itself as a function,
as explored in [Metalearned Neural Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09720.pdf).

To be precise, the output from the memory
is a function $M$ of the input query.
The key idea is to parametrize the
memory $M$ by a neural network.
At every timestep $t$, an LSTM controller 
outputs three quantities:
* The read-in key $k_{r_t}$
* The write-in key $k_{w_t}$
* The values $v_{w_t}$

The read-out keys $v_{r_t}$ are then computed 
via a forward pass of the memory $M_t$:

$$
  v_{r_t} = M_t(k_{r_{t}})
$$

For the write-out keys $\hat{v}_{w_t}$,
the process is similar, but uses the memory
parameters from the previous timestep:

$$
\hat{v}_{w_t} = M_{t - 1}(k_{w_{t}})
$$

The parameters of the memory $M$ are optimized
to encourage binding by minimizing the distance between
the values
$v_{w_t}$ and 
the write-out keys
$\hat{v}_{w_t}$.

In contrast to the ESBN where the LSTM controller
only controls what is written to the memory,
the LSTM controller in the MNM generates two sets of keys,
$k_{r_t}$ for reading and $k_{w_t}$ for writing to the memory. 
To recall, in the ESBN, the key being read from the memory
is computed using the encoded image at the current timestep.

### 4. Transformers

[Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)
have become extremely popular in sequence modelling problems.
Compared to the three models just discussed which process inputs one at a time,
the Transformer processes the entire sequence at once to generate a prediction.
The core of the Transformer is the self-attention block, described below.

First, we linearly project the encoded image $z_t$ to
a query $q_t$, a key $k_t$ and a value $v_t$:

$$
q_t = W_q \cdot z_t \\
k_t = W_k \cdot z_t \\
v_t = W_v \cdot z_t
$$

Then, we compute the attention weights
$w_t \in \mathbb{R}^T$ for each timestep:

$$
w_t = \text{softmax}\left(q_t \cdot k_i\right)
$$

and then use these weights to combine the values,
giving us a new embedding $z'_t$ for each timestep:

$$
z'_t = \sum_{i = 1}^T w_{t_i} v_i
$$

These embeddings $\{z'_t\}$ are passed through a shared MLP,
averaged and provided as input
to another MLP to generate a final prediction.

### 5. Relation Networks

The [Relation Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01427.pdf)
is a general architecture
that explicitly models pairwise relations
between instances.
In particular, given the sequence $\\{z_t\\}$ of encoded images, 
the Relation Network $\text{RN}$ computes:

$$
\text{RN}(\{z_t\}) = f\left(\sum_{t, t'} g(z_t, z_{t'})\right) 
$$

where $f$ and $g$ are parametrized by neural networks.

The Relation Network can be seen as an extension of 
the [Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06114.pdf) architecture
to allow for pair-wise relations:

$$
\text{DS}(\{z_t\}) = f\left(\sum_{t} g(z_t)\right) 
$$

Like Deep Sets, the Relation Network is invariant
to the ordering of the images in the input.
To give the Relation Network information
about the exact positions
of the images in the input,
every embedding $z_t$ was appended
with the integer $t$ as a 'temporal tag' feature.

This positional information
is essential when considering the Distribution of Three 
and Identity Rules tasks.
The Relation Network however cannot model ternary relations
(that is, relations between three objects $z_t, z_{t'}, z_{t''}$),
which explains its poor performance on these tasks.
A variant of the Relation Network called the
[Temporal Relational Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08496.pdf)
that can explicitly model ternary relations
performed better on these tasks.

### 6. PrediNet

Similar to the Relation Network,
the [PrediNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10307.pdf)
takes a relation-oriented modelling approach,
but using self-attention blocks, similar to the Transformer.

The PrediNet consists of multiple heads,
the outputs of which are simply concatenated at the end. 
For clarity, here we describe the operation of a PrediNet with only
one head.
 
Given the sequence of embeddings $\\{z_t\\}$ as a matrix $L$
of leading dimension $T$,
PrediNet first flattens $L$. Then, it computes two sets of
query vectors $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and a key matrix $K$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_1 &= \text{flatten}(L)W_{Q1} \\
Q_2 &= \text{flatten}(L)W_{Q2} \\
K &= LW_{K} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The query vectors $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are specific to each head,
while the key matrix $K$ is shared across heads.

Each entry in $K$ is now queried against both
$Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and the result is softmaxed
to give weight vectors $w_1$ and $w_2$,
each of dimension $T$.
Informally, these weight vectors
indicate how much each of the $T$ objects
match with the query vectors $Q_1$ and $Q_2$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_1 &= \text{softmax}(Q_1K^T) \\
w_2 &= \text{softmax}(Q_2K^T) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, these weight vectors are used to compute
two representations $E_1$ and $E_2$ of the entire sequence as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_1 &= w_1L \\
E_2 &= w_2L \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, the difference between these representations
is computed, and mapped to a $j$ dimensional vector
by multiplying with $W_S$.

$$
D = (E_1 - E_2) W_S
$$

This vector $D$ is passed to an MLP
to generate the final predictions.

## Temporal Context Normalization

The authors found that normalization across the timestep axis,
termed [Temporal Context Normalization (TCN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05059.pdf),
helped the performance of all models significantly.
In the table below, $m$ refers to the number of withheld symbols (out of $100$)
that are *not* observed during training.

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/results.html %} 

Consider a batch $Z$ consisting of $B$ sequences
of encoded images, each of length $T$,
where each encoded image has $K$ features.
Then, by $Z_{itk}$, we mean the $k$th feature of $z_t$
where $\\{z_t\\}_{t = 1}^T$ is the $i$th sequence in the batch.
Then, TCN performs the following normalization:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu_{ik} &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t = 1}^{T} Z_{itk} \\
\sigma_{ik} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t = 1}^{T} (Z_{itk} - \mu_{ik})^2 + \epsilon} \\
Z'_{itk} &= \frac{Z_{itk} - \mu_{ik}}{\sigma_{ik}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\epsilon$ is a small positive value to avoid division by zero.
Thus, TCN is the analogue of batch normalization, but applied to the timestep axis,
instead of the batch axis.

{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/tcn.html %} 

In this work, TCN is applied to the full sequence of $\\{z_t\\}$
obtained from the image encoder $f_e$.
The normalized sequence $\\{z'_t\\}$ is then 
fed in to the sequence model $f_s$.

## Visualizing ESBN's Symbolic Representations

To understand if ESBN's representations are indeed instance independent, and capture the task dependent 
properties for predicting the correct answers, we visualize the learnt representations in the memory for all
four symbolic tasks studied in the paper. The keys written to the memory ($k_{w_t}$) are the outputs of the ESBN
network, which describe the information ESBN stores for future at current time step ($t$). The keys retrieved
from the memory ($k_{r_t}$) represent the input to the LSTM, and thus decide the output for the current 
time step ($t$). We plot the first three principal components of variations in all plots, which cover more than
$90\%$ variation in the representations for each of the four tasks. 

### Visualization the Evolution of Representations

As mentioned above, the 'write' keys $k_w$ computed by the ESBN
can be thought of as symbolic representations of the encoded image seen at each time step. 
We train the ESBN model with the provided hyper-parameters for each of the symbolic tasks to generate these representations.
All experiments are performed with a train set of $5$ symbols, and thus, a test set of 
$95$ unseen symbols.

Below, we illustrate how the key representations evolve during training,
starting from their values at initialization for the first 100 training steps. The learnt key representations ($k_w$) across different time step are shown using different colors.
We observe that the keys computed by ESBN model seem to be
independent of the actual image being encoded. 

#### Same-Difference Task: Evolution During Training
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_same_diff_train_slider_epoch.html %}

For the **Same-Different** task,
we find that the ESBN learns to separate the two timestep representations
without any dependence on the actual symbol being encoded.

#### RMTS Task: Evolution During Training
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_RMTS_train_slider_epoch.html %}

The ESBN only requires a few epochs to converge for the **RMTS** task.
The variance of key representations increases with $t$, indicating
some level of uncertainty. A possible explanation is that once 
the first option pair at $t = 3, 4$ has been seen, the ESBN model can technically
already guess the right answer, without actually seeing what the second option pair is at
$t = 5, 6$, since exactly one of the option pairs is always correct.
This means the network might not need to exactly localize the representations
of the second option pair at $t = 5, 6$ to obtain good performance.

#### Distribution of Three Task: Evolution During Training
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_dist3_train_slider_epoch.html %}

Similar to the **RMTS** task, the ESBN requires only a few epochs
to converge for the **Distribution of Three** task.
For clarity, we plot the key representations only corresponding 
to the questions, not the options. 
The option time steps are very diffused since only one of the options is correct
and the other options map to 'nonsensical' symbols.
We see that the key representations for each time step cluster well.

#### Identity Rules Task: Evolution During Training
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_identity_rules_train_slider_epoch.html %}

In the **Identity-Rules** task, the representations
do not cluster as well as in the other tasks,
but there is still a clear structure.
This is because of the added complexity here
where the ESBN has to identify
one of three repetition rules from the question.
As above, we plot the key representations only corresponding 
to the questions, not the options. 

For all tasks, the keys written at the first two time steps
($t=1,2$) are tightly clustered at one location for all training examples.
From the third time step onwards, the encoded key is task dependent.
Tight clustering of key representations for a given time step represent the capabality of ESBN to learn task-dependent symbolic representations across different examples for the given task.

### The Generalizability of ESBN Representations

In the following subsections, we compare ESBN representations 
for train and test instances, across the four different tasks.
Overall, we find that there is significant overlap in the 
structure of the train and test representations, even though
the test symbols are completely unseen during training.

This explains why the ESBN model is able to generalize to near-perfect accuracy on all tasks
unlike any of the other baselines,
even when the ESBN has observed only a small subset of symbols
during training.

#### Same-Different Task: Generalization
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_same_diff_trend_subplot.html %}
In this plot we show the keys written by the ESBN network ($k_w$) at $t=1$, and how it compares to
the key that the network reads after seeing the second input at $t=2$. The LSTM predicts whether the 
input at $t=2$ is same as or different from the input at $t=1$ using the input $k_{r_2}$ and the hidden
state $h_1$. The figure shows how representations of $k_{r_2}$ differ based on whether the example is 
**Same** or **Different**, showing how ESBN creates a decision boundary for these two cases. Further, 
the strong clustering for these two cases show that ESBN learns instance invariant representations as claimed in the paper.
This generalisation is observed for both test and train examples, and the representations align closely.

#### RMTS Task: Generalization
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_RMTS_trend_subplot.html %}
For the **RMTS** task, we plot the representations for $k_{r}$ for $t= 3$ and $4$ denoting the two possible cases
for each example. The output of ESBN model would depend on whether the inputs at $t= 3$ and $4$ follow the same relationship as inputs at 
$t= 1$ and $2$. This can be observed in the segregation between *same relation* (green and orange) and *different relation*
(purple and sky blue) $k_r$ representations. For the *same relation* case, 
the test representations align well with the train representations. However, when there is a  *different relation*,
the test representations seem to interpolate between the clusters formed by the train representations.


#### Distribution of Three Task: Generalization
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_dist3_trend_subplot.html %}
For the **Distribution of Three** task, the first three inputs uniquely determine the symbols for the next three time steps. 
We plot the retrieved representations ($k_r$) for the first match of the corresponding input at $t = $ 1, 2 and 3. In the plot, 
we observe that the test representation closely matches with the train representation within the expected range of the training examples.
However, there are lot of outlier data points in the test representation.
The generalisation of performance on the test distribution is not perfect,
and the representations do not align well with the train distribution.
In the appendix of the paper, the representations for the
test distribution are shown only in range of the train representation. When observed in this range, the train and test representations are well aligned. However, there are some outlier test instances which outside the train representations range showing that the alignment is not perfect.


#### Identity-Rules Task: Generalization
{% include 2022-03-25-emergent-symbols/3D_identity_rules_trend_subplot.html %}
For the **Identity-Rules** task,
we plot the $k_w$ representations for the time steps corresponding to the question,
and see how the keys $k_r$ read for the different correct differ.
The repetition rules in the Identity Rule task are of three types - *ABA*, *ABB*, or *AAA*. 
Based on the repetition rule, and the sequence of inputs seen so far, there is high variation in the representations.
For the four option time steps, we plot the representations for each correct or incorrect option separately. 
Since an incorrect option in one example, (say symbol *B* if the rule is *ABA*) could be the correct option for another
example (symbol *B* would be the correct answer if the rule is *ABB*), there is high variation for both the incorrect
and correct option time steps. Further, the representations are intermixed. For the **Identity-Rules** task, the
train and test representations align closely.

Based on our analysis of the retrieved and written representations encoded by ESBN, we can infer that the model
is indeed able to abstract symbol-like representations (such as 'first image', 'second image', 'same image as second')
which are independent of the identity of images. Even under the strong setting of $95$ heldout symbols, the model 
generalises extremely well (albeit not perfectly) on the test set. 


## Open Questions and Conclusion

The ideas in this paper raise some important questions:
* The datasets investigated here are rather simple. Can such factorized memory systems solve more complex visual tasks,
such as answering questions from the [CLEVR](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/) dataset?
* Can we achieve similar performance without requiring linear $\Theta(T)$ memory? Improvements here
will enable the wider use of augmented memory systems, especially for problems
that require larger temporal context.
* Can factorized memory allow for the joint processing of multi-modal inputs,
where the use of symbolic representations would enable reasoning across modalities
such as text and video?
* There is a certain appeal in simplicity, but would ESBN benefit from more complex
memory addressing mechanisms beyond simple dot-products, such as those found in the NTM?

In conclusion, we have described the motivation and working of the ESBN
in great detail, compared its design choices to strong baselines,
and performed a qualitative validation of the generalization claims
from the original paper. We believe the community will benefit
from the clear exposition of the valuable ideas in this paper.
